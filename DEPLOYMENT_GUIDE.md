## üîß Configuration Files

### For All Platforms
The build process uses these npm scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "eleventy",
    "serve": "eleventy --serve",
    "clean": "rm -rf _site"
  }
}
```

### Netlify Configuration (Optional)
Create `netlify.toml` in your project root:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "_site"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```

### Vercel Configuration (Optional)
Create `vercel.json` in your project root:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "_site"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üö¶ Choosing the Right Platform

### Choose GitHub Pages if:
- Your repository is already on GitHub
- You want the simplest setup
- You don't need advanced features
- You're okay with the `.github.io` domain

### Choose Netlify if:
- You want the best developer experience
- You need form handling
- You want advanced deployment features
- You need custom redirects/headers

### Choose Vercel if:
- You prioritize performance
- You want the best global CDN
- You need advanced analytics
- You plan to add API routes later

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails**:
   - Check that `package.json` has correct dependencies
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility
   - Check for syntax errors in templates

2. **Deployment Permissions**:
   - Ensure repository has correct permissions
   - Check that secrets are properly configured
   - Verify token permissions

3. **Custom Domain Issues**:
   - Verify DNS settings
   - Check CNAME file is correct
   - Allow time for DNS propagation

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check Action Logs**:
   - Go to Actions tab in GitHub
   - Click on the failed workflow
   - Review detailed logs

2. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run serve
   ```

3. **Validate Build Output**:
   - Check that `_site` directory is created
   - Verify files are generated correctly
   - Test the built site locally

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For All Platforms:
- Enable build caching (already configured)
- Optimize images before adding to assets
- Use responsive images
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript

### Platform-Specific:
- **GitHub Pages**: Use Jekyll-compatible plugins
- **Netlify**: Enable build optimization and asset optimization
- **Vercel**: Use their image optimization service

---

## üîÑ Workflow Management

### Using Multiple Workflows:
1. Keep only the workflow file you want to use
2. Rename unused workflows to `.yml.disabled`
3. Or use conditional logic to enable/disable based on branch

### Branch-Based Deployments:
- `main/master`: Production deployment
- `develop`: Staging deployment (configure separately)
- `feature/*`: Preview deployments (platform-dependent)
